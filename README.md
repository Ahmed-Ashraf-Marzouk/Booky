# Booky

Welcome to the source code directory of Booky. This repository contains the source code for the Booky application, an online book management system. Here you will find the codebase for the backend server and the frontend web application.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `/backend`: This directory contains the backend server code, built with Node.js and Express.js. It handles the business logic, API endpoints, and database operations.
- `/frontend`: This directory contains the frontend web application code, built with React.js. It provides the user interface for interacting with the Booky system.
- `/database`: This directory contains the database schema and migration scripts used by the backend server.

## Getting Started

To set up a local development environment and run the Booky application, follow these steps:

### Backend

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if they are not already installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `/backend` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Set up your database and update the database configuration in `/backend/config/database.js`.
5. Run the database migration scripts using the provided migration tool.
6. Run `npm start` to start the backend server.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Update the API endpoint in `/frontend/src/api/index.js` to point to your backend server.
4. Run `npm start` to start the frontend development server.

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the Booky application by opening it in your web browser.
